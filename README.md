This is a take-home assignment for applying for a job at Nooro.  Feel free to reuse any of the code (for what it’s worth; I ran out of time before I finished it), though giving me some credit would be nice.

Setup:  You select a device to run this thing on in Xcode and run.  There are no external libraries or anything like that to complicate things.

Note:  If this thing ends up finished, it’s because I decided to finish this thing anyway and reuse some of the code for another project.
